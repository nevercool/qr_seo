# qr_seo

This is a server with clients for relaying OSC messages to interactive applications. We are developing it to support interactive applications at the 2011 Student Exhibition Opening at the College for Creative Studies.

Adapted from code in osc-web: [https://github.com/automata/osc-web](https://github.com/automata/osc-web)

Dependencies:

- Node.js
- socket.io

To run the server: $ cd qr_seo $ node server.js

**TODO:**

- Build template for client apps
- Create setting for client sync/no sync
- Create setting for inactivity timeout on client w/inactive display state
